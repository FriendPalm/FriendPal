    <p>It is likely that you have written a letter to an anonymous person when you were in elementary. Back then, it was
      a way for us children to practice our handwriting (if we wrote it), and to also get a brief taste of conversing
      through writing letters. That activity you once did is a term known as pen pal. A pen pal is a person with whom
      one keeps up an exchange of letters, usually someone far away that a personal meeting is unlikely
      (Dictionary.com). The term is very broad, as it means everyone can write to anyone. But our application,
      FriendPal, wants to specify the pen pal term by targeting a specific demographic, college students. We feel that
      college students will benefit from it the most, as it is easier for students to relate to one another.
      College is an enormous journey for many people, for it shapes our future and helps us create bonds with people we
      meet through our years. But there are stages in college where meeting new people can be proven difficult. There
      may be a semester that you have to focus heavily on classes, which causes you to sacrifice your social life. You
      lose that semester’s worth of opportunities to make new friends, which can be demoralizing for some. There are
      times when one might say, “I wish I had someone to talk to, someone to rant with, someone to cope through the
      struggles of being a college student”. With our FriendPal application, college students will have the freedom to
      do that, either anonymously or not.
      When you use our app, you must create an account using your college email address. This prevents a person from
      creating multiple personas. It will also help the application randomly generate, based on location, a potential
      pen pal for you. Once an account is created, you are given options to either respond to a letter or create one
      yourself. Making a letter is similar to making a blog post on WordPress. You can add media to compliment your
      letter, and also create tags, which help other users filter their search when looking for a potential pen pal.
      Simple email, text messaging, and internet chat applications also do similar things, but we allow users to talk to
      more than just others who speak the same language as that user. We will be incorporating a translator that can be
      modified to help review or learn a language. Google has a translator that they incorporate into emails that
      automatically detects if a message is sent in a language other than your default language. There may be an
      instance where you (an English speaker) are paired with a student from Korea, and communication will be difficult
      since both users will have problems talking to each other. With our app, users will not have to worry; after
      writing your letter, the app will translate it, making it ready to read for students from foreign countries. The
      letter you write will be read in 44 different languages in countries all over the world.
      Patience is a trait that a few college students have, which makes waiting for a reply to your letter a bit nerve
      wracking. The FriendPal app can also be set to accept live chat invitations from users currently online. The app
      will also have the option to have as few or as many pen pals you like. You will be able to set a preference, such
      as the activity level you think you will have for this app. If you feel you can manage more than one pen pal, set
      your activity level to the max and the app sends your introduction letter to people around the world that it
      thinks will be compatible with you.
      Here is a simple scenario, Sy wants to conduct a survey for his group project, but it needs people from various
      countries to max out its potential. From his application screen, it would look something like this,
      And here is how the application screen would look like if it were viewed from a person that speaks Spanish,
      Our goal for our application is to make it accessible as possible. We want it to be a universal application for
      every college student to use.
      This application will be free of cost for students, and it will only make money through plug-ins such as
      incorporating mail services, to send each other packages. The purpose for this application is to prevent students
      from feeling like they’re alone during their college careers, and to aid them by supplementing them an application
      that maintains the social aspect you experience in college.
      The hardware and software requirements to use FriendPal are quite minimal. The general hardware needed for both
      Android and iOS is the camera, GPS, roughly 100MBs of space. FriendPal will need access to the camera so you can
      document your letters, and the GPS is needed to share your location in your letters. For software requirements,
      FriendPal supports OS 8 or later and Android 4.4 or later. </p>
